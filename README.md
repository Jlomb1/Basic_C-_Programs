<h1>Basic_C#_Projects</h1>
<p>In this repository I have added basic C# programs and small challenges that I have learned while going through The Tech Academy's C# and .NET Bootcamp. A lot of the challenges are super basic "how-tos" while learning and navigating through Visual Studios and the .NET Framework, but there will also be detailed projects that I have built when I was going through the C# course.</p>
<h3>Below you will find some of the big projects that were built using C# and the .NET Framework:</h3>

<h2>Package Express</h2>
<p>The Package Express program is a command-line application that determines if the users input for a package is too big or too heavy to be <br>
shipped. It will frist determine if the package is too heavy, if not, it then will take the user input for width, height, and length to determine <br>
if the package is too big. If the package isn't too big, it then give the user an estimated total, then exits the program.</p>
<h2>Car Insurance Approval</h2>
<p>In this Console-app we ask the user questions to determine if they are qualified for car insurance. The user will input their age, answer if <br>
they have ever had a DUI as well as any speeding tickets, and then prints to the console if the user is qualified or not based on the users input.</p>
<h2>News Letter SignUp</h2>
<p>The News Letter SignUp is an ASP.NET MVC Web Application that utilizes Entity Framework. In this web app you can sign up to a news letter <br>
that saves the user input and then stores it on a SQL database.</p>
<h2>Car Insurance Quote</h2>
<p>For this Project I have created an ASP.NET MVC Web Application that also utilizes Entity Framework. The program simply has the user fill out a <br>
form to see what there car insurance quote will be based on the user input. The quote is heavily based on the users age, car year, car make, and if <br>
they have ever had a DUI or speeding tickets before. After the program builds a quote, it stores this information in the SQL database where you can update, <br>
add, and remove any stored data.</p>
<h2>Twenty One Game</h2>
<p>The Twenty One Game is a command-line application where you can play a game of Twenty One with the program. You are able to start with an amount <br>
and place a bet and then you are dealt cards to see if you or the dealer win!</p>
<br>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I have gained a lot of technical skills going through the C# and .NET Boot Camp offered by The Tech Academy. I have learned anywhere from a <br>
simple console app, to full blown ASP.NET MVC web app that uses Entity Framework and many other packages inbetween. I have learned so many terms and <br>
concepts like, arrays, abstract classes, branching, boolean logic, constructors, exceptions, lambda expressions, loops, iterations, polymorphism, <br>
try catch blocks, and so much more. On top of all of that, I am still constantly learning!</p>
